# Rails Heroku starter project

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)


## Bare essentials

This was created with Ruby 2.7.1 and Rails 6 with rvm

It additionally uses sqlite3, postgres

Webpacker uses nodejs 12.16.2+ with yarn through nvm

### System dependencies

This is designed to run on debian and ubuntu systems, but should be compatible with any *NIX system such as OSx for Mac

## Disclaimer

This is some opinionated boilerplate. Don't become upset if it's not much more robust than Rails out-of-the-box.
